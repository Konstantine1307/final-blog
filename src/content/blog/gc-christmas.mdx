The weather has been delightful lately, allowing Leslie and me to establish a comforting routine of soaking up the winter sun at the beach. The contrast is stark compared to the gloomy and cold atmosphere back home.

On the evening of December 22nd, we had the pleasure of dining with Estrella, Agnes, our niece Nayra, and her girlfriend. Opting for a Greek restaurant, we decided to celebrate our ancestral cuisine—a delightful surprise for us all. To our unexpected delight, my nephew Ale and his lovely family were also present at the restaurant.

Warm greetings, hugs, and joyous exchanges filled the air as we caught up with each other. The atmosphere was filled with love and excitement before we sat down for dinner at the charming [Green Village](https://www.sabordegrecia.com).

Our exuberance might not have been universally appreciated by the other diners, but we reveled in our togetherness—10 of us creating a lively presence with smiles, laughter, and eventually, the shared enjoyment of delicious food and wine.

We opted for a diverse selection from the menu, intending to share the flavors and memories. The food was outstanding—fresh and special, reminiscent of our beloved Mum Katy's Greek culinary creations.

It was an enchanting evening, filled with laughter, love, and cherished moments in the best company possible: FAMILY!
