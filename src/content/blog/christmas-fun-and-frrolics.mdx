On Christmas Eve we had a get together to thank those who had supported Helen and Derek through their difficult times over the past 18 months. Special guest of honour was the man who saved Derek's life. It was the first time Derek had met the hero and was a very emotional experience.

For Christmas Day Helen and Derek, Leslie's sister and brother-in-law, generously opened their home to our extended family so nineteen family members could come together to celebrate.

After dinner Brian, Helen and Leslie visited the head-stone of Samuel and Janet Campbell, their 3 times great grandparents who arrived in New Zealand in 1861.

As family came and went over the four days there was lots of fun and new memories were made. We hope everyone reading this had a wonderful Christmas too and that the Church Family get together for more great times like this.
