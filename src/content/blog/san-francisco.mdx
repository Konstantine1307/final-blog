## San Francisco

No, this is not our bank sort code; it's the number of floors we tried rooms at the [Hyatt Regency Downtown SOMA](https://www.hyatt.com/hyatt-regency/en-US/sford-hyatt-regency-san-francisco-downtown-soma) on before we settled on one that suited us. Mustafa and the team at the front desk have the patience of saints.

### Things we learnt whilst in San Francisco:

    <IndentedText variant="facts">There is sufficient steel rope in the Golden Gate Bridge to go round the world 5 times; now why would you want to do that?</IndentedText>

    <IndentedText variant="facts">Even on a wet day the [Salesforce Sky Garden](https://www.tjpa.org/salesforce-transit-center/salesforce-park) is impressive in its scale and variety of planting.</IndentedText>

![Fog and Wind Garden in San Francisco Downtown](/san-fran/fog-and-wind-garden.webp 'Fog and Wind Garden in San Francisco Downtown')

    <IndentedText variant="facts">The San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus put on a great concert with perfect diction and tuning, even with 20% of the 200+ singers wearing face masks. Oh, and they were lots of fun including several Cher moments. Oh, and the audience were significantly middle class straight families.</IndentedText>

    <IndentedText variant="facts">It rains a lot in San Francisco.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">Toilets, which are located in "restrooms", flush super efficiently.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">Whilst the neighbourhoods are distinct the overall feeling of friendliness and welcoming is felt in every corner of this city; maybe the ever present aroma of a certain 5 fingered green plant helps with this.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">We loved Union/Polk Streets. It helped that the sun was shining.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">Union Square is home to some super rich stores.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">A block away from Union Square are people who carry all their processions in a plastic bag, if they are fortunate enough to have one.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts">Homelessness, addiction and lack of health care are huge issues in this city of contradictions.</IndentedText>
    <IndentedText variant="facts"> For both of us, San Francisco remains a favourite city. This was our first time visiting together, we hope it won't be our last..... we still need to ride a cable car together!</IndentedText>
